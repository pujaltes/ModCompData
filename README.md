# ModCompData

Repository to store data for the assignments for Computational Methods in Neuroscience I & II. This makes it easier to share work as one can easily fetch the data with just the GH url, thus requiring no changes to the code.

This is kept seperate from the private solutions repository for obvious reasons.
