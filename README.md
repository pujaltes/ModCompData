# ModCompData

Repository to store data for the assignments for Computational Methods in Neuroscience I & II. This makes it easier to share work as one can easily fetch the data with just the GH url, thus requiring no changes to the code.

This is kept seperate from the private solutions repository to allow one to fetch the data without having to deal with credentials.

Note: When reading csv files from github you must use the raw url. For example, for the TiemposNeuDPC1 data use: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pujaltes/ModCompData/main/mod_comp1/TiemposNeuDPC1.csv'
